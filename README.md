# Deep Learning <sub><sub>ðŸ“š</sub></sub>

So, good news, I found a book that's interesting and beginner friendly on `Deep Learning`, `Grokking Deep Learning` by `Andrew W. Trask`. I had read a similar one `Grokking Algorithms` by `Aditya` and I enjoyed the weekend with it. I'm hoping to have the same experience reading this one.

The main bait for this is that it requires `python` and `high school math` to read it and given its chapters, it is captivating and promising. I have all the requirements I need to embark on this journey.

## Targets

1. Demistify Deep Learning
1. Learn Deep Learning without Machine Learning and AI knowledge
1. See the subject from a novice POV
1. Have a good experience akin to my read on `Crafting Interpreters`

## Bonus

Along side this book am looking at algorithms, project architecture, and math which should enable me to read this book swiftly. Have created a basic programming langunge as a project which up-ed my programming skills big time and deepened my python knowledge overall. With this, I'm ready to conquer the world.
